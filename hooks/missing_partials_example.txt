Greetings fellow farmer!

We have identified your launcher id %(launcher_id)s has stopped sending any partials to our pool in the last hour!

Please make sure your farm is set up correctly and there are no network issues.

If you have decided to leave our pool we are very sorry to see you go. We hope we can work together again in a near future!

Cheers!
